### InvestSuite Python Test Preparation Puzzle ðŸ§©

**Challenge Goal**
Write a Python function that accepts "a number" and outputs the number of (base-10) digits needed to write the integer part of that number on a piece of paper. Here, "a number" is any Python type in the standard library that behaves as a number (including but not limited to 'int' and 'float').

**Example input & output**
- Input: 100, Output: 3
- Input: 999, Output: 3
- Input: -10, Output: 2
- Input: 3.1415, Output: 1

**Evaluation Checklist**
- Correct output for all 'int's and 'float's (including edge cases).
- Correct output for other number types in Python's standard library.
- Tests that convince us that your implementation is correct.
- Correct & complete type annotations for the input and output.
- At most 50 lines of code (including comments, excluding imports, excluding tests).
- Function docstring that follows any convention (NumPy, Google, ...).
- In-line comments that explain the purpose of lines that are not self-explanatory.
- The implementation "reads like a book".
