# InvestSuite Python Coding Test 🧩

## **Challenge Goal**
Write a Python function that accepts "a number" and outputs the number of (base-10) digits needed to write the integer part of that number on a piece of paper. Here, "a number" is any Python type in the standard library that behaves as a number (including but not limited to `int` and `float`).


###  **Example input & output**

(in=100, out=3), (in=999, out=3), (in=-10, out=2), (in=3.1415, out=1)


## **Evaluation Checklist**

✅ Correct output for all `int`s and `float`s (including edge cases)

✅ Correct output for the other number types in Python's standard library

✅ Tests that convince us that your implementation is correct

✅ Correct & complete type annotations for the input and output

✅ At most 50 lines of code (including comments, excluding imports, excluding tests)

✅ Function docstring that follows any convention (NumPy, Google, ...)

✅ In-line comments that explain the purpose of lines that are not self-explanatory

✅ The implementation "reads like a book"

⚠️ We will not evaluate the speed of your program in any way, shape, or form!

You may send the solution in any private format that is convenient to you.
