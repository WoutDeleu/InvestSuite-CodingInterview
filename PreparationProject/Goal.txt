Challenge goal
 
Write a Python function that accepts "a number" and outputs the number of (base-10) digits needed to write the integer part of that number on a piece of paper. Here, "a number" is any Python type in the standard library that behaves as a number (including but not limited to 'int' and 'float').
 
Example input & output
 
(in=100, out=3), (in=999, out=3), (in=-10, out=2), (in=3.1415, out=1)
 
Our evaluation checklist
 
· Correct output for all 'int' s and 'float' s (including edge cases);
· Correct output for the other number types in Python's standard library;
· Tests that convince us that your implementation is correct;
· Correct & complete type annotations for the input and output;
· At most 50 lines of code (including comments, excluding imports, excluding tests);
· Function docstring that follows any convention (NumPy, Google, ...)
· In-line comments that explain the purpose of lines that are not self-explanatory;
· The implementations "reads like a book".
 
📍We will not evaluate the speed of your program in any way, shape or form!
